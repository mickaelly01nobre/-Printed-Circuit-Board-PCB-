#  SPV1040

The SPV1040 device is a low power, low voltage, monolithic step-up converter with an input voltage range from 0.3 V to 5.5 V, capable of maximizing the energy generated by solar cells (or fuel cells), where low input voltage handling capability is extremely important. Thanks to the embedded MPPT algorithm, even under varying environmental conditions (such as irradiation, dirt, temperature) the SPV1040 offers maximum efficiency in terms of power harvested from the cells and transferred to the output. The device employs a voltage regulation loop, which fixes the charging battery voltage via a resistor divider.

It is possible to set the maximum output current according to charging requirements by a sense resistor .

The SPV1040 protects itself and other application devices by stopping the PWM switching if either the maximum current threshold (up to 1.8 Apk) is reached or the maximum temperature limit (up to 155 °C) is exceeded. An additional built-in feature of the SPV1040 is the input source reverse polarity protection, which prevents damage in case of reverse connection of the solar panel on the input.
