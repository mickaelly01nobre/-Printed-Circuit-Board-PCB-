# L6924D 

The L6924D is a fully monolithic battery charger dedicated to single-cell Li-Ion/Polymer battery packs. It is the ideal solution for space-limited applications, like handheld equipment, and digital cameras. It integrates all of the power elements (the power MOSFET, reverse blocking diode and the sense resistor) in a small VFQFPN16 (3 x 3 mm) package. When an external voltage-regulated wall adapter is used, the L6924D works in linear mode, and charges the battery in a constant current/constant voltage (CC/CV) profile. Moreover, when a current-limited adapter is used, the device can operate in quasi-pulse mode, dramatically reducing the power dissipation. Regardless of the charging approach, a closed-loop thermal control avoids device overheating. The device has an operating input voltage ranging from 2.5 V to 12 V. The L6924D allows the user to program many parameters, such as pre-charge current, fast-charge current, pre-charge voltage threshold, end-of-charge current threshold, and charge timer. The L6924D offers two open collector outputs for diagnostic purposes, which can be used to either drive two external LEDs or communicate with a host microcontroller. Finally, the L6924D also provides very flexible control of the charge process termination and gas gauge capability, as well as other functions, such as checking for battery presence, and monitoring and protecting the battery from unsafe thermal conditions.
